### 👋 Hey there!

I’m **Tushar Jadhav**, a tech enthusiast and aspiring software developer, currently learning Angular and web development one bug at a time.

This blog, **“The Debug Diaries,”** is my personal space to share everything I learn — from small discoveries to big breakthroughs — in the world of frontend development.

### 💡 Why I Started This Blog

Like many beginners, I’ve often struggled to find simple, clear explanations while learning new technologies. I realized that writing about what I learn not only helps me understand better, but also helps others who are just getting started.

So I thought — *why not document my journey and help others too?*
